# New-Space-Weather-Data-Analysis
Analysis of New Space Weather to Predict the Weather of Next Days

Jupyter Notebook is used in the development and writing the Python code.

This project is about analyzing the data of competitors like NASA and Space Weather Live and our 
data on new space weather to predict the climate of the upcoming days and the data of top 50 solar flares.

The first part is scraping the data from HTML files using python modules like Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Prettify.

The second is the analysis part and plotting the digrams of the insights using the MatPlot module.
